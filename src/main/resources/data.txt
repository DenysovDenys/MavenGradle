Built a house to burn it down
Ran our faith into the ground
The last words came out your mouth
Is that were going nowhere

But we're gonna do what we're gonna do
And say what we're gonna say (ooo)
And even though it's all in the past
Doesn't mean it's all ok, (yeah)

I stayed awake all night
Tryna write the perfect lines
You’ve always wanted someone to write
You a song, a song
Well I got something on my mind, on my mind
(ooo, yeah)
And I got one thing to, one thing to, sing to you, to you
Fuck you
(Fuck you)

(Hey, yo yo yo, don chill
Let me hit em with this one real quick)

Slow it down it’s my turn
Not my fault you never learn
Said you tried, that’s a lie
And this dream that I’ll never find
Why are you inside my mind?
It’s creeping up and telling me
That we’re just running out of time
I’ve said this shit a thousand times
I'll say it a thousand more
You built me up and broke me down
While you’re living safe and sound
So here it is, what you wanted
Know that I’m just getting started
I’ve got something on my mind
This is where you get left behind

I stayed awake all night
Tryna write the perfect lines
You’ve always wanted someone to write
You a song, a song
Well I got something on my mind, on my mind
(ooo, yeah)
And I got one thing to, one thing to, sing to you, to you
Fuck you

Well I got something on my mind, on my mind
(ooo, yeah)
And I got one thing to, one thing to, sing to you, to you

I stayed awake all night
Tryna write the perfect lines
You’ve always wanted someone to write
You a song, a song
Well I got something on my mind, on my mind
(ooo, yeah)
And I got one thing to
One thing to sing to you, to you
Fuck you
